## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- Basic understanding of command line

### Running the Examples

1. Navigate to the examples directory:
   ```bash
   cd python_basics/examples
   ```

2. Run any example script:
   ```bash
   python 01_variables_and_types.py
   python 02_control_flow.py
   python 03_functions.py
   python 04_data_structures.py
   ```

### Working on Exercises

1. Open `exercises/exercises.py` and try solving the problems

2. Run your solutions:
   ```bash
   cd python_basics/exercises
   python exercises.py
   ```

3. Check your answers against `solutions.py`:
   ```bash
   python solutions.py
   ```

## Learning Path

### Beginner Track (Recommended Order)

1. **Start with the Guide**
   - Read through PYTHON_BASICS_GUIDE.md
   - Use it as a reference throughout

2. **Run the Examples**
   - Execute each example script in order
   - Modify the code and experiment
   - Understand what each line does

3. **Practice with Exercises**
   - Start with exercises 1-10 (fundamentals)
   - Progress to exercises 11-20 (more advanced)
   - Compare your solutions with the provided ones

4. **Build Projects**
   - Combine concepts to create small programs
   - Think of problems to solve with code
   - Practice, practice, practice!

## Tips for Learning

1. **Type the code yourself** - Don't just copy-paste. Typing helps muscle memory.

2. **Experiment** - Modify the examples and see what happens. Break things!

3. **Read error messages** - They're your friends. Learn to understand them.

4. **Practice daily** - Even 15-30 minutes a day is better than long sporadic sessions.

5. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn to real problems.

6. **Join communities** - Ask questions, help others, learn together.
