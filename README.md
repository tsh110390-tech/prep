# Credit Card Application Demo

A simple, client-side experience for new credit card applicants. Collects key personal details, estimates eligibility, and previews likely credit limits, APR bands, and perks based on user input.

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the directory locally with a static server (for example: `python -m http.server 8000`).
2. Complete the form and submit to see an eligibility preview. Use **Start over** to reset the flow.

## Notes
- All calculations are mock values for demonstration purposes only.
- No data is sent to a server; the app runs entirely in the browser.
